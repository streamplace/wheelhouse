[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/streamplace/wheelhouse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/streamplace/wheelhouse)

Wheelhouse is a tool for managing sophisticated Javascript projects that target Kubernetes using
[Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm).

It draws heavy inspiration from the one-command development processes in projects like [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) and [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and builds upon the dependency model from [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/).

Wheelhouse is being jointly developed by [Streamplace](https://stream.place) and [C-SATS](https://www.csats.com).
